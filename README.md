# 🎙️ RecallOS - AI-Powered Audio Memory System

> Winner submission for Google Cloud Run Hackathon - AI Agents Category

## 🏆 What Makes RecallOS Special

RecallOS is the first audio memory system with **autonomous multi-agent coordination** and **cross-conversation pattern analysis**. Unlike traditional transcription services, RecallOS uses 4 AI agents that dynamically plan, negotiate, and execute tasks to provide intelligent insights across ALL your audio files.

### Novel Innovation: Cross-Conversation Insights

Our breakthrough feature analyzes patterns across multiple audio files to discover:
- Recurring topics and themes
- Speaker engagement patterns over time
- Decision evolution across conversations
- Timeline visualization of discussions

This goes beyond single-file analysis to provide meta-insights about your entire audio library.
